I'm Ting-Wei Li, a second-year Ph.D. student at the [Department of Computer Science @ University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/). I am a member of [iDEA-iSAIL Joint Laboratory](https://www.idea-isail.com/) and my supervisor is Prof. [Hanghang Tong](http://tonghanghang.org/). I previously interned at Amazon (Prime Video, Summer 2025) and AT&T (AT&T Labs, Fall 2023).

My research interest lies in **data-centric machine learning** and **graph machine learning**. I like to explore and advance the entire data lifecycle, including data attribution, data selection and data generation. For applications, I am particually interested in recommendation systems and LLM-based agentic systems.

Before joining UIUC, I received my master's degree from [ECE @ University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://ece.engin.umich.edu/) and bachelor's degree from [EE @ National Taiwan University](https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/eng/index.php). I also worked with [Prof. Jiaqi Ma](https://jiaqima.github.io/) and [Prof. Qiaozhu Mei](https://websites.umich.edu/~qmei/).
