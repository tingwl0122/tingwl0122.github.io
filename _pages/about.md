I'm Ting-Wei (Tim) Li (ÊùéÂª∑Â®Å), an incoming Ph.D. student at the [Department of Computer Science @ University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/). My supervisor is Prof. [Hanghang Tong](http://tonghanghang.org/).

My research interest lies in **graph machine learning**, **trustworthy machine learning** and any intersection of the above two areas. For applications, I am particually interested in social network analysis and interactions betwen LLMs and Knowledge Graphs.

Before joining UIUC, I received my master's degree from [ECE @ University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://ece.engin.umich.edu/) and bachelor's degree from [EE @ National Taiwan University](https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/eng/index.php). I also work extensively with [Prof. Qiaozhu Mei](https://websites.umich.edu/~qmei/), [Prof. Jiaqi Ma](https://jiaqima.github.io/) and [Prof. Yao Ma](https://yaoma24.github.io/).
